= RRD stats guide (not only) for OpenWrt users =

If you want to enable long-term statistics for your openhr20, follow these steps:

1) 
Choose directory for *.rrd file storage. Because each of them will be written every 4 min,
it should not be placed on flash storage. For OpeenWRT router, I'm using /tmp, which is a ramdisk 
(a virtual storage kept only in RAM memory). When your staorge dir is ready, adjust path in 
frontend/tools/create_rrd
and set RRD_PATH variable.

and run the script for every radio ID you want the stats to be collected, for example:
./create_rrd 10

2)
From the statistics collected in *.rrd files, nice *.png plots can be generated - and that's
what we want. So, adjust the
frontend/tools/plot
script. Set:
RRD_HOME=/tmp/openhr20/
IDS="10 11 12"
PLOTS="${RRD_HOME}/plots"
RRD_HOME must point to the same directory as in create_rrd script. IDS must include space separated
list of radio IDs of thermostats, which you want the plots to be created. PLOTS shows where png with 
plots will be kept. The only argument needed to run the script is the number of days, which is to be
plotted.

3)
Check the path for RRD files in daemon.php
$RRD_HOME="/tmp/openhr20/";
It must point to the same directory as before. Make sure, that rrd is installed in your system. Now,
when you start the daemon, the data will be logged to RRD databases.

4)
Configure WWW frontend. Edit config.php and set:
$RRD_ENABLE=true;
$PLOTS_DIR = "plots";
$RRD_DAYS = array (3, 7, 30, 90);
RRD_ENABLE enables the RRD plots in frontend. PLOTS_DIR must point to a directory (on OpenWRT it must be
relative to the www root path) with *.png plots. So, on OpenWRT make a symlinc in root ww dir, like:
ln -s /tmp/openhr20/plots .
RRD_DAYS is a list of ranges (in days), for which plots will be related. This must be consistent with
settings from 5).

5)
Last, but not least: setup cron to generate plots periodically. Enter:
crontab -e
and adjust everything to your liking. For example:
*/15 * * * * /home/root/frontend/tools/plot 3
@hourly /home/root/frontend/tools/plot 7
0 4 * * * /home/root/frontend/tools/plot 30
0 5 * * * /home/root/frontend/tools/plot 90
means, that a 3 day plot should be generated every 15 minutes, 7 days plot every hour, and 30 and 90 days
plots once a day, at 4 am and 5 am, respectively.

6) You're done. Keep in mind, that create_rrd script creates a database in such way, that full resolution
(every sample, every 4 minutes) is kept for 3 months, then 1:4 (4 samples agregated into 1) are kept for
1 year and 1:15 databse is kept ofr 3 years. And it takes only 5.9MB per radio ID! 
Have fun!
